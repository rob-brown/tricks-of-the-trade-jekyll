While attending university I was fairly consistent in writing on [my blog](http://robsprogramknowledge.blogspot.com). I've scarcely touched it since then. Several years later, my blog still gets 2,000 to 7,000 hits per month. It's a pleasant surprise. I feel that there is much more I can share with the community than these out-dated articles.

Now I'm trying again. This time I've built my own blogging system. The incentive is to learn new technologies. For the front-end, I'm using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org). The back-end is just [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) serving static pages from a [Macminicolo server](https://macminicolo.net). For content management I'm using [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com). Eventually I plan on [open sourcing](https://github.com/rob-brown) my code. The intent is more to share examples with the community rather than build a plug-and-play blogging system.

So far I've been happy with the results and have learned a lot in the process. I plan to channel this new knowledge and experience into future projects. All the while, I hope to share my insights with others too.

I got my domain name set up: [tricksofthetrade.pro](http://tricksofthetrade.pro). The name comes from some old episodes of MacGyver. MacGyver has an old friend Jack Dalton that gets him into trouble. When Jack gets him out of trouble he says "Tricks of me trade me boy, tricks of me trade." With this blog I share the tricks that get me out of trouble and, unlike Jack, stay out of trouble.

I used [Hover](https://hover.com/LE86A9Qf) to register the domain name. I love their search tool. Often it's hard to find a domain name that isn't already taken. Hover offers many suggestions and offers a wide variety of TLDs. If you use [this referral link](https://hover.com/LE86A9Qf) then I'll get $2 towards my next renewal.

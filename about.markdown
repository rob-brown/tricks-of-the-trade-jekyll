## Personal

Currently, I am an Elixir backend developer and software architect working for [Tubi](https://tubitv.com). I have worked for agencies and as an indpendent contractor for a decade prior. During that time I built iOS apps and web backends for a large variety of clients (see below).

I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from [Brigham Young University](http://byu.edu).

I served a two-year mission for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.lds.org/) in [Winnipeg, Canada](http://www.mission.net/canada/winnipeg/missioninfo.php).

I love making things. I have many [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc), [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org), a couple [Parallelas](http://www.parallella.org), [BeagleBone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black), and other similar boards. I build my own [drones](https://www.flickr.com/photos/92242245@N04/9598282973/in/album-72157635239040891/). I own a [3D printer](https://flic.kr/p/egLBcA), I have a small wood shop and  a [laser cutter](https://voccell.com/wp/product/dls/). I coached a [robotics team](http://www.firstinspires.org) for six years (2010–2015).

I run [@elixirtip](https://twitter.com/elixirtip) on Twitter where I post daily tips on using the Elixir programming language. At the time of this writing, I have over 12,000 followers.

I love software architecture and study it extensively. I strive to find and design architectures that are simple, maintainable, and comprehensible.

## Projects

Often the first question for developers is what apps they've made. The following are iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS apps that I've built roughly in the order I made them. There is some overlap between them. Links are provided for apps that are publicly available on the App Store or to respective websites. Some apps are no longer available or are enterprise only.

## Programming languages

Programming languages are often a form of identity for developers. More generally I identify as a software architect, autodidact, and polyglot.

Over the years I've learned a number of programming languages. Some I've used for a single project or class. Others I've used for years. To distinguish them, I've categorized them below.

### Favorite languages

The languages I enjoy using most, listed in descending order of preference.

* Elixir
* Rust
* Swift
* Elm

### Proficient languages

Listed (very roughly) in descending order of proficiency.

* Elixir
* Swift
* Rust
* Objective-C
* C
* C++
* Java

### Languages used in projects

All languages (listed alphabetically) I've used in any project (greater than 1000 lines).

* Bash
* C
* C++
* Elixir
* Elm
* Erlang
* Java
* JavaScript
* LaTeX
* Objective-C
* Objective-C++
* Python
* Ruby
* Rust
* Swift
* SQL
* LaTeX

### Languages learned on the side

The following are languages (listed alphabetically) I have learned through school or self-study but haven't used in a sizable project.

* BASIC
* C♯
* Go
* Haskell
* Pharo
* Prolog
* PHP
* R
* Racket
* Tcl

### Languages I hate

* JavaScript
* PHP
* Python

Enough said.

### Languages I want to know better

I try to follow the challenge of learning a new language each year. Most languages I learn to adopt new ideas. Other times I end up loving the language and using it regularly. The following is my bucket list ordered alphabetically.

* Crystal
* Dark
* Eve
* Haskell
* Idris
* Lisp-Flavored Erlang (LFE)
* OCaml
* Pharo
* R
* Wolfram Language
